# Diabetes-Prediction-using-Knn
This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting diabetes outcomes using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. The project involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation.

Key Highlights:

Data Cleaning: The dataset is cleaned, handling missing values and transforming zeros into meaningful data.

Feature Engineering: Relevant features are created for analysis and prediction.

K-Nearest Neighbors: The KNN classifier is implemented for diabetes outcome prediction.

Model Evaluation: The project evaluates the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, F1 score, and confusion matrices.

How to Use:

- Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

- Run the Jupyter Notebook to explore the code and follow the project's analysis.

- Understand the process of predicting diabetes outcomes through machine learning.

Results:

The diabetes prediction project achieved the following results:

Accuracy: The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier achieved an accuracy of approximately 80.52% in predicting diabetes outcomes.

F1 Score: The F1 score, a measure of the model's precision and recall, is approximately 0.659. This indicates a balanced performance between correctly identifying positive and negative diabetes outcomes.

Confusion Matrix: The confusion matrix shows that the model correctly predicted 95 instances of non-diabetic cases and 29 instances of diabetic cases. It had 18 false positives and 12 false negatives.

These results demonstrate the project's ability to predict diabetes outcomes with reasonable accuracy and precision, offering valuable insights for healthcare professionals and researchers.
